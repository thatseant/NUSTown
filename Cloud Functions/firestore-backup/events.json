Popularly known as SQ, here‚Äôs what he has to say!\n> When did you start breaking?\n2008.\n.\n>What is breaking to you?\nA hobby, a distraction from work, a break from stress, an exercise, a time to create, a metaphor for life, a place to progress and learn.\n.\n>What would you look out for when judging?\nCleanliness, style, originality, musicality.\n.\n>What advice would you give to the freshies who are attending the jam for the first time?\nLet's be honest. You're a uni student. You're studying computer science, engineering, economics, business, etc. You may have a plan for the future and that likely does not involve breaking. \nSo, make the jam fun for yourself. This is an internal jam, not a competitive one. Everyone's your friend or friendly. Enjoy the music, enjoy the vibes, have a dance conversation with your friends. \nThis jam says nothing about you. If you lose, it doesn't mean you are bad. If you win, it doesn't mean you're good. It's for fun. So, just enjoy it. \nLastly, if you're prepping for the jam, focus on two things. Your foundational moves and executing them well. You're still young, still learning. Things like style, flava, originality don't matter for you yet. Make sure your foundation's good and you're doing them properly. Take this week to drill it. \nDoing the simplest things is sometimes the hardest :)\n___\n\nREMEMBER:\nDate: 17 November 2019\nTime: 1-7pm\nLocation: Utown DA2\n\nSEE YALL THERE! üòöüòã","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/72397363_984396225259882_2205776798326325869_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=A0FYhiFq4WkAX8kMVdv&oh=08c4ba6473fbdf4aac7569bbfe40f8db&oe=5F4109FC","NUS Students' Cultural Activities Club_191117_13 Nov"],"16 Nov":["ENTER: BreakiNUS Internal Jam 2019 ‚òÑÔ∏èüóØü§Ø\n.\nOnly 1 more day to our annual BreakiNUS Internal Jam! üí• ARE YOU READY?!?!üòàüëª\n.\nIntroducing our man on the mic, we have our very own Yuan Hao!

The event showcases the diverse non-academic opportunities the student community offers to its members, drawing crowds of over 10, 000. Inaugurated in 2014, the SLF has since been the premiere student life event in the academic calendar, attracting over 150 student committees, clubs and societies, NUS departments and offices and cooperate partners.\r\nInstead of the usual 2 day physical fair, we will be conducting a 5 day online campaign to properly introduce and promote all the student organizations in NUS. The 5 days would be spread out throughout the week 1 of semester and online activities with free giveaways will be conducted as well.","",""]},"__collections__":{"messages":{"5mtRk21D35DMkoNGxFSc":{"timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595674568,"_nanoseconds":883000000}},"user":"Tim Ong_AJ0FUgstffeFapkPTEXJFIGLN5m1","text":"Def can't more than 5 ppl rite","__collections__":{}},"8d0muOZiDBpX596J4v0z":{"text":"ohh really ah","timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595676923,"_nanoseconds":683000000}},"user":"Marcus Low_gFEAiLRUHifGSJ5IHxL8AZmaFur1","__collections__":{}},"BENG6gbXQoReTlLN8ujH":{"text":"I heard there's some new CCAs this year","timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595676559,"_nanoseconds":854000000}},"user":"Jia Wei_ms3ecXVO0tPiENP8V57WNMFW4MC3","__collections__":{}},"GrXbUfjykPQviCkd8MRW":{"user":"Marcus Low_gFEAiLRUHifGSJ5IHxL8AZmaFur1","text":"Hopefully these CCAs not online haha","timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595676437,"_nanoseconds":145000000}},"__collections__":{}},"TA7VwV81RU9sgwYH0HoM":{"text":"Will this sem even have CCAs?","timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595674442,"_nanoseconds":628000000}},"user":"Tim Ong_AJ0FUgstffeFapkPTEXJFIGLN5m1","__collections__":{}},"ifOBuvGC2KGzTnMSJLGR":{"text":"Plus some ppl won't bother come sch 1 since all online","timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595675731,"_nanoseconds":909000000}},"user":"Marcus Low_gFEAiLRUHifGSJ5IHxL8AZmaFur1","__collections__":{}},"nweMuuOiHCFxqZeGknAX":{"timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595676958,"_nanoseconds":59000000}},"user":"Marcus Low_gFEAiLRUHifGSJ5IHxL8AZmaFur1","text":"I think I'll go checkout the fair see what CCAs can join once they resume","__collections__":{}},"vtXl5Tqh7RMjMUWYuiyP":{"user":"Marcus Low_gFEAiLRUHifGSJ5IHxL8AZmaFur1","text":"Ya now there's zoning all that","timestamp":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595674669,"_nanoseconds":147000000}},"__collections__":{}}}}},"Office of Student Affairs_200601":{"syncEventID":"6008496","place":"Online","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/event/6008496","lastUpdate":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1595246864,"_nanoseconds":200000000}},"updates":{"NUSync":["Welcome Freshmen to the virtual NUS EXperience (NEXUS)!\r\nWe&rsquo;re in extraordinary times, but that does not deter us from putting up an extraordinary Orientation experience specifically for you!
