This time, we are featuring an unprecedented collaboration with NUS KotoKottoN, where you will get to experience the creative interweaving of music from two different stringed instruments, the guitar and the koto (a traditional Japanese zither). Set in the Edo period of Japanese history üáØüáµ , Variations on Sakura üå∏ will delight you with a unique rendition of the traditional folk song originally written for the koto by Michio Miyagi, a blind composer. The dynamic rainy season of Japan is illustrated through the piece Ame ~ Mizu to Hikari no Fantasia (Fantasia of Rain and Light) ‚òî , which captures both the tranquillity ‚òÅ and turbulence üåä of rain in a single soundscape.

As we moved through the paved and off-beat trails, we learned about the different kinds of graves and their layouts. We understood that they weren't just graves, but the story of a person‚Äôs life. After the trail, we could better appreciate the importance of Bukit Brown as a heritage site in Singapore.\n.\nWe would like to give a special thanks to Beng Tat and Fabian from All Things Bukit Brown (a.t.bukitbrown) for sharing with us about the rich history of Bukit Brown. Overall, it was a lovely morning spent outdoors with friends exploring a rustic piece of our history. -Yangjie, PD üë£üçÉ","org":"NUS Rovers","id":"NUS Rovers_200226","isPastEvent":true,"imgUrl":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/87506418_795310407656028_3864362542305897876_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=XIGSSR9JAqQAX9sjwCP&oh=369d462aa9efcfd7d88f28701af86f7c&oe=5F1EE7C6","name":"NUS Rovers","rating":3,"place":"A Place","url":"","lastUpdate":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1582699650,"_nanoseconds":0}},"__collections__":{}},"NUS Rovers_200322":{"lastUpdate":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1583053718,"_nanoseconds":0}},"category":"Other Events","updates":{"01 Mar":"Dear adventurers,\n.\nDue to the escalating COVID-19 situation, NUS has suspended all co-curricular activities till 22 March 2020, after which the policy would be subject to further review.\n.\nIn adherence to these measures, Rovers Adventure Club will be postponing all treks until further notice is given by the school.

Popularly known as SQ, here‚Äôs what he has to say!\n> When did you start breaking?\n2008.\n.\n>What is breaking to you?\nA hobby, a distraction from work, a break from stress, an exercise, a time to create, a metaphor for life, a place to progress and learn.\n.\n>What would you look out for when judging?\nCleanliness, style, originality, musicality.\n.\n>What advice would you give to the freshies who are attending the jam for the first time?\nLet's be honest. You're a uni student. You're studying computer science, engineering, economics, business, etc. You may have a plan for the future and that likely does not involve breaking. \nSo, make the jam fun for yourself. This is an internal jam, not a competitive one. Everyone's your friend or friendly. Enjoy the music, enjoy the vibes, have a dance conversation with your friends. \nThis jam says nothing about you. If you lose, it doesn't mean you are bad. If you win, it doesn't mean you're good. It's for fun. So, just enjoy it. \nLastly, if you're prepping for the jam, focus on two things. Your foundational moves and executing them well. You're still young, still learning. Things like style, flava, originality don't matter for you yet. Make sure your foundation's good and you're doing them properly. Take this week to drill it. \nDoing the simplest things is sometimes the hardest :)\n___\n\nREMEMBER:\nDate: 17 November 2019\nTime: 1-7pm\nLocation: Utown DA2\n\nSEE YALL THERE! üòöüòã","16 Nov":"ENTER: BreakiNUS Internal Jam 2019 ‚òÑÔ∏èüóØü§Ø\n.\nOnly 1 more day to our annual BreakiNUS Internal Jam! üí• ARE YOU READY?!?!üòàüëª\n.\nScratchin the disc for tomorrow, we have the ex-president of BreakiNUS, Mervyn! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nHi it me.
