The name King Edward Hall was chosen to restore the historical significance related to the university. To avoid confusion, &lsquo;at KR&rsquo; was included until King Edward Hall at Sepoy Lines closed.King Edward hall at Kent Ridge was officially declared open on 5th December 1981 by then- President of Singapore and Chancellor of NUS, Mr. Devan Nair. Four years later, in December 1985, the hall embraced a new name, departing from KEKR to Kent Ridge Hall in order to create a new identity and tradition free from the shadow of KEVII. Pro-chancellor at NUS, Dr. Justice A. P. Rajah, officiated the Hall Renaming Ceremony.The following year marked the unveiling of the new Hall Crest and Hall Motto by President Wee Kim Wee. The new Hall Motto was first proposed by residents of the hall and then discussed and modified to take the form it has today- &lsquo;Seek, Strive and Excel&rsquo;. The motto expressed the essence of the hall and its residents, the continual seeking for knowledge and truth, the striving for high ideals in spite of difficulties, and the excellence which marks all that is undertaken by us to do. The source of our hall spirit and a driving force of our achievements is our strong family culture. It is believed that the camaraderie forged during our stay here will pave the way for our renewed goal, that of being &ldquo;the Family Hall ever striding for excellence&rdquo;, reinforced by the Family Song introduced in 2002.In November 2002, KR was relocated from its original site in Lower Kent Ridge Road to its current location at Heng Mui Keng Terrace. The move was symbolically represented by having the then-residents walk over to the new building, which was officially opened on 3rd January 2004 by former President S. R. Nathan.Despite the move, the culture of Kent Ridge Hall has not only survived, but thrived in its new home. From outstanding results in FLAG and RAG, yearly productions and most recently, becoming champions of the Inter-Hall Games (IHG) in 2014, it become clear that the spirit of excellence KR embodies remains ever-present in the hall.","id":"295095","websiteKey":"kent-ridge-hall","__collections__":{}},"King Edward VII Hall":{"info":"The motto &ldquo;To strive, To seek, To serve&rdquo; embodies the philosophy of KEVII Hall.\r\nTO STRIVE: To attempt great things &ldquo;for God and country&rdquo; has been the battle cry of soldiers and the catalyst that drove sailors like Columbus and Magellan to seek new worlds. Striving for excellence in purposeful achievement is not learnt overnight. It requires discipline, grit and a measure of toughness. The experience of exerting oneself against stiff odds in field and forum is worthwhile even if the limits of endurance are stretched to the extent of numbness. It cannot but breed the qualities of patience, endurance and courage.\r\nTO SEEK: The true university spirit encourages the students to develop an &ldquo;insatiable curiosity&rdquo;. In this age of science and technology, every student and graduate has a duty to contribute to the store of knowledge he receives from past generations. In the Hall, the intermingling of the Fellows and students of the varied discipline should give opportunities for dialogue, discussion and debate on the quest of the &lsquo;Why&rsquo; and &lsquo;How&rsquo;.\r\nTO SERVE: A developing nation needs a core of national builders, dedicated and skilled with a capacity for hard work. Whether the service is scientific research, general practice or the civil service, should not matter; it is the quality of service that counts. Ample opportunities exist in the Hall to develop the sense of community service and individual obligation. &ldquo;To serve and not to be served&rdquo; is a challenge calling for utter dedication and selfless service. The response cannot come from without but from within the person.","id":"295032","websiteKey":"king-edward-vii-hall","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/04b73bd3-9e29-41e6-a161-6591954ab213687f01de-568a-4a50-abf9-d40715fb785f.png","catID":"","name":"King Edward VII Hall","branchId":262919,"followers":1517,"catName":"","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/king-edward-vii-hall","__collections__":{}},"Korean Cultural Interest Group":{"cat":2,"info":"To promote Korean culture to the entire NUS student body as well as to provide a welcoming platform for all students interested in Korea.","id":"295224","websiteKey":"korean-cultural-interest-group","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/320a3686-19f7-4247-824e-539e5baf34564d99de02-3f82-450e-aa25-2b5d9733e53d.jpg","catID":"13694","name":"Korean Cultural Interest Group","branchId":262921,"followers":636,"catName":"Interest Groups (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/korean-cultural-interest-group","__collections__":{}},"Malay Language Society":{"imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/8b727386-f005-4eeb-a6cf-f6e4b67a2178c95beb82-6ebb-44e5-b079-02aa5439729c.jpg","catID":"13695","name":"Malay Language Society","branchId":262917,"catName":"Societies (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/malay-language-society","cat":2,"info":"Persatuan Bahasa Melayu University Kebangsaan Singapura (PBMUKS) is also known as the National University of Singapore Malay Language Society.","id":"295143","websiteKey":"malay-language-society","__collections__":{}},"NUANSA Cultural Productions":{"catName":"Interest Groups (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/nuansacp","cat":8,"info":"NUANSA is a musical cultural production presented by the students of National University of Singapore.

Highlights have included the  NUS Centennial Everest Expedition in 2005, which put the first born-and-bred Singaporean, Teo Yen Kai (an MIR 2 member and alumni) on the world's highest summit; the Singapore Women&rsquo;s Everest Team (SWET) which saw members Jane Lee and Sim Yi Hui (from MIR 6) part of; and the initiation of expeditions to climb  Ong Siew May and Ong Teng Cheong Peaks in Kazakhstan as part of a partnership with Ong &amp; Ong Foundation, which garnered front-page headlines on The Straits Times.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nToday, our mission to spread the spirit of mountaineering throughout the NUS community is being realised through our regular mountaineering courses and trips. In recent years, NUS students have embarked on their rites-of-passage as new MIR members first through their basic  Technical Mountaineering Course (TMC) in the Himalayas, and many have gone on to fine-tune and pursue mountaineering further in places like the European Alps, New Zealand, the Tianshan mountain range, North and South America.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLearn more about us on&nbsp;https://nus-mir.com/.&nbsp;Think you have what it takes to be part of NUS Mountaineering?

Presently under the direction of award-winning theatre maker Edith Podesta (Dark Room, Bitch: The Origin Of The Female Species), NUS Stage is steadily growing to become a vibrant and innovative campus group for aspiring theatre-makers. Its members comprise uniquely of NUS students from varying backgrounds who are passionate about inspiring change through riveting performances and creating a common space where people can come together.\r\nRecent productions include A Disappearing Number (NUS Arts Festival 2019 - Opening Show), which unveils a new staging of Complicit&eacute; UK&rsquo;s exquisite and internationally acclaimed play about love, math, and how the past and future connect. Winner of the 2007 Critics&rsquo; Circle Theatre, Evening Standard and Laurence Olivier award for Best New Play, A Disappearing Number was reimagined and brought to the stage for the first time in Singapore by director Edith Podesta, NUS Stage members, along with veteran actors Koh Wan Ching, Pavan J Singh and Ramesh Panicker. Other productions include The Golden Record 2.0 (NUS Arts Festival 2018) which shifts the focus from the universal to the local scene by creating a conversation about the tokens and memories of our nation&rsquo;s identity that Singaporeans will choose to send as a message to the universe when faced by the possibility that such tokens could be sent into space.\r\nNUS Stage seeks to find bold and creative new angles through collaborations with other CFA groups. In 2018, NUS Stage collaborated with Electronic Music Lab (EML) to present The City Remembers, a play drawn heavily from Alfian Sa'at&rsquo;s poetry anthology, A History of Amnesia. Created out of workshops utilizing Anne Bogart&rsquo;s Composition and Laban acting techniques, the actors embodied the stories set to a live soundtrack composed by musicians from EML, which teased out the darker sides of living in a modern multicultural society.\r\nIn addition to acting, NUS Stage members also get to hone their crafts by taking on different roles such as playwriting, directing and stage managing in the annual student-led showcase.

We are committed to bringing you the best student life experience on and off the field.&nbsp;\r\nWhat is NUS Silat?\r\nTo start, Silat is a martial art that originated in the Malay archipelago, namely Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. It consists of striking such as punches and kicks and also grabs, throws and take-downs. There are 2 aspects to it, Seni (artisitc) and Tanding (fighting) which makes use of the different techniques in silat. Here at NUS Silat, we are an NUS Varsity Team that trains competitively in Seni and Tanding.\r\nCompetition and Training Sessions\r\nOur varsity team competes in one main competition each academic year - the annual Tertiary Silat Championship in Semester 1. As we are a mixed gender team, we train together on Mondays and Thursdays at MPSH 2 from 6.30pm to 9.30 pm with a half hour break in between.&nbsp;Even amidst the unfortunate Covid-19 situation, we are still active and highly motivated to keep ourselves fit by engaging in virtual training sessions through Zoom/Skype.\r\nOur team works ardently to soar higher and achieve better results every year. As proven, we have managed to increase our medal tally and overall position from 2018 to 2019 at the annual Tertiary Silat Championship. This is a result of our coaches training us athletes to be fearless and resilient during training and in competition - following our motto of &ldquo;Respect All, Fear None&rdquo;.&nbsp;\r\nNUS Silat Values\r\nHere at NUS Silat, we have three core beliefs that every athlete must embody&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGive your 100%\r\nSupport one another\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nThese tenets are simple, yet they drive our attitude during training. It is common to see us pushing beyond our limits and cheering to support one another during training. While we train hard, we play hard as well - initiating several impromptu meals or having a mass bonding session throughout the semester. We have our annual Hari Raya Outing, Iftar and Bonding Camp to bond as a team. We welcome all students, regardless of ethnicity or sports background, to have fun and sweat it out with us during our training sessions.&nbsp;\r\nNUS Silat gives back\r\nNUS Silat firmly believes in giving back to the community. For the past few years, NUS Silat has volunteered during the fasting months to distribute food for the break fast to those who need it more. On top of that, we recently collaborated with other NUS Varsity Teams under MAXINUS, a NUS Taekwondo-led service project, to pass on the knowledge of Silat to primary school children.\r\nContact us\r\nFor more of what we do as NUS Silat, check out our Instagram and  Facebook page or drop any of the exco members a message.

As such, the hall has a long and rich history. Raffles Hall was originally locaed in Nassim Road, Bukit Timah, alongside Eusoff College. At that time, Raffles Hall was an all-boys hall. However, due to an increase in the number of female students, Raffles Hall officially became co-ed in 1975. In 1981, NUS shifted from the Bukit Timah campus to the current Kent Ridge campus. The establishment of two new halls there took a toll on Raffles Hall&rsquo;s residential numbers. Consequently, Raffles Hall bade farewell to Nassim Road and moved to the Kent Ridge Campus in 1984. The new Raffles Hall site was almost twice the size of the old Nassim Road site. Raffles Hall has its roots in Raffles College, which was one of the institutes of higher learning that merged to eventually form the National University of Singapore (the other being King Edward VII college). Raffles Hall was also modelled after the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and hence many of their traditions trickled down to us. The positions of the Master, Resident Fellows, Junior Common Room Committees (JCRCs) and Senior Common Room Committees (SCRCs) all stemmed from those origins. And although &ldquo;Raffles&rdquo; is a common name for many institutions and organisations in Singapore, Raffles Hall is in no way affiliated to them.","id":"295160","__collections__":{}},"Red Cross Youth - NUS Chapter":{"catName":"Interest Groups (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/red-cross-youth-nus-chapter","cat":3,"info":"Red Cross Youth - National University of Singapore (RCY - NUS) Chapter started our humble origins in 1994, and has since expanded to a range of 9 different projects.\r\nOur projects range across various aspects such as humanitarian aid and community service. Members of the RCY will be affiliated to the Singapore Red Cross, one of the largest international humanitarian movement in the world. Here are the brief introduction about our projects:\r\nBlood Donation Drive (BDD)\r\nNUS Blood Donation Drive is a joint effort between Red Cross Youth (NUS Chapter) and Health Science Authority (HSA) to provide a convenient avenue for the NUS community to donate blood. As we continue to enlist the generosity of our existing donors, we strive to recruit first-time donors to enlarge our blood donor pool.\r\nDisaster Management Group (DMG) \r\nDMG aims to create a disaster-resilient NUS via first aid and disaster management courses. We contribute to the local community by providing first aid coverage at various events eg. school-based activities, to provide medical assistance when required. Furthermore, first aid exposure and training courses such as the Standard First Aid Training, CPR &amp; AED and ​National Disaster Response Team Training courses are provided to empower our volunteers to readily react to various medical incidents. If you would like to learn life-saving skills or put your existing medical skills into practice, join our team today!\r\nFundraising\r\nThe 3 main objectives of Project Fundraising is: (i) To encourage people to spread love and express their gratitude to their loved ones while contributing for a donatable cause. (ii) To raise funds for the execution of the 8 respective Red Cross Youth Chapter projects. (iii) To inculcate the spirit of volunteerism and to raise the awareness of the current Red Cross Youth Chapter projects amongst the NUS community.\r\nProject CLARE\r\nProject CLARE stands for Community-Led Action for REsilience. Our focus is to increase and facilitate the interaction with the elderly community in Tampines West, especially those who are isolated and low-income earners. We achieve this in two ways. First through our elderly befriending, which requires volunteers to commit to a monthly home visit and phone calls to our elderly beneficiaries. Not only that, Project CLARE also organise events, known as Activities Day, for the elderly living around the Tampines neighbourhood to bond and interact. Through our regular visits and events, we hope to achieve and cultivate a sense of belonging and happiness among the elderly. These interactions encourage the elderly to form new friendships with the volunteers and enjoy the different activities that are prepared for them. Furthermore, volunteers get to develop their communication skills, compassion, understand people from different walks of life and gain insights from the stories that the elderly shares through their visits.\r\nProject R.I.C.E.+\r\nProject Rice+ is SRCY's signature student-run project that is organised annually. Our project started off as a collection and redistribution of rice event 10 years ago. Along the years it has evolved in various forms to its current iteration, for which we are now able to distribute bundle sets containing food items and daily necessities to our beneficiaries islandwide. As part of Project's RICE+ consistent efforts to enhance not just the contents of our bundle sets, but also our personal connection with our beneficiaries, project rice+ 2018 was the first time we conducted beneficiary engagement, a platform for our volunteers to engage with our beneficiaries on the ground through meaningful activities and interaction.\r\nProject Smiles\r\nProject Smiles is an initiative that serves the mentally and physically disabled residents of the Red Cross Home for the Disabled (RCHD). We visit the RCHD on every alternate Sunday morning to interact with our residents, who are mostly bedridden and have limited mobility. By playing interactive games and communicating with them, we hope to improve their motor and social skills. More importantly, by keeping them company, we hope to make them feel that they are never alone. Join us in spreading smiles today! We're excited to hear from you.\r\n7 Days of Happiness (7DOH)\r\nProject 7 Days of Happiness (7DOH) aims to give back and bring joy to the university&rsquo;s Unsung Heroes and students. 7DOH hosts a series of events such as Appreciation Tea sessions and Drinks Dedication to thank our Unsung Heroes for their immense contribution in ensuring the daily functioning of the university. With Appreciation being an important value of the project, we strive to initiate the first step for students to express their gratitude towards our Unsung Volunteers through various platforms. We also serve as the connecting bridge between the students and our organisation for volunteering opportunities with our sister project.\r\ni.Volunteer\r\nAn initiative under NUS Red Cross Youth, i.Volunteer aims to expose NUS students to volunteerism in hopes of inspiring first-time volunteers to become more in touch with the community. i.Volunteer is in its 7th year now and have reached out to more than 20 different organisations, bringing joy to Children, Elderly, the Intellectually Disabled as well as the Physically Disabled among our population. Many volunteers have stepped into i.Volunteer as an individual with little understanding and interest in giving back but left with the heart to serve and have hence gone on to participate in many other volunteer projects. In the span of a day, volunteers get to interact with their beneficiaries closely, giving them the chance to not only forge a new friendship but also the chance to learn the stories of these beneficiaries. With the unwavering support and funding from Office of Student Affairs (OSA), our beneficiaries and volunteers have had the opportunity to engage in many fun-filled activities and outings to local tourist spots.\r\nOverseas Humanitarian Program (OHP)\r\nThe overseas humanitarian program hopes to give NUS students exposure to other national societies in the world on how they operate and function as well as learn best practices so as to improve the programs we have in Singapore. Traditionally the program was designed as an OCIP to help out the less privileged but this year we have modified it to take advantage of Red Cross bring an international organization to bring about a unique experience on what an international organization is about. So join us in this pioneering journey to forge lasting friendships and unforgettable experiences.","id":"295171","websiteKey":"red-cross-youth-nus-chapter","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/073bfb72-7363-4c9a-b7d2-6bde23a1d1aa993d1479-95cf-4b39-b27e-28fa97de8666.jpg","catID":"13694","name":"Red Cross Youth - NUS Chapter","branchId":262921,"followers":479,"__collections__":{}},"Residential College 4":{"imgUrl":"","catID":"13687","name":"Residential College 4","branchId":262919,"followers":1252,"catName":"Residential Colleges","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/rc4","info":"RC4 intends to integrate academic and personal life in a residential setting to develop &ldquo;Systems Thinking&rdquo; using interdisciplinary issues, foster all around student development through in- and out-of-class learning experiences.

Together, they strive to fulfil the Faculty’s mission of excelling in clinical care, research and education. Currently, the Faculty has an intake of 54 undergraduates students annually.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty works closely with departments in the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and other teaching hospitals and institutions across Singapore in healthcare delivery and education. It also partners departments in other faculties of the University, public institutions and private enterprises in multi-disciplinary research activities.\r\n\r\nThe NUS Faculty of Dentistry is situated at 2 locations; its own building at 11 Lower Kent Ridge Road (at the junction between Medical Drive and Lower Kent Ridge Road) and the other at the National University Hospital (NUH).\r\n\r\nThe main FOD building is within 6 minutes walking distance from NUH. It houses the teaching facilities and clinics for the undergraduate dental students and graduate residents in the fields of Prosthodontics, Orthodontics and Diploma in Implantology. The FOD building also houses the Dean’s office and admin complex together with the Academic staff offices.\r\n\r\nThe facilities at NUH provide graduate residency training in Endodontics, Periodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.

Besides a broad range of dental services catering to the Singapore public, it will focus on the elderly and those with medically complex conditions. It will cater to an increased annual undergraduate intake to train more dental professionals, employing advanced simulation laboratories to promote leading-edge and experiential dental training. NUCOHS will be part of the National University Health System, which is an integrated Academic Regional Health System that delivers value-driven, innovative and sustainable health care in Singapore.

Located in Singapore, which for more than a century has been a commercial hub at the crossroads of Asia, NUS Law is very much Asia&rsquo;s Global Law School. Since 1957 our curriculum has been infused with perspectives from other jurisdictions and disciplines. This tradition has accelerated in recent years, providing a legal education that is comparative, international, and multi-disciplinary. The Law School hosts many visiting faculty and students from every continent, offering a lively, cosmopolitan atmosphere both inside and outside the classroom. The strength of the NUS Law curriculum lies in the broad and diverse range of subjects it offers. In addition to a rigorous core curriculum, students can choose electives in areas ranging from Asian legal studies to banking and finance, from public international law to intellectual property, or from arbitration to jurisprudence. The aim is to provide a liberal education that enables our graduates to think critically and creatively, as globally-oriented lawyers with a strong sense of their role in society. Global, regional, and uniquely Singaporean perspectives on legal issues are all evident in the research produced by our faculty. The professors at NUS Law are not only engaged in a constant search for better legal solutions to the issues that confront all societies, but are also continually challenging accepted wisdom and conventional norms by raising new questions and problems to be confronted. Their work stretches across all aspects of law and appears in the most prestigious journals as well as books published by leading university presses around the world.

Together, they strive to fulfil the Faculty’s mission of excelling in clinical care, research and education. Currently, the Faculty has an intake of 54 undergraduates students annually.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty works closely with departments in the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and other teaching hospitals and institutions across Singapore in healthcare delivery and education. It also partners departments in other faculties of the University, public institutions and private enterprises in multi-disciplinary research activities.\r\n\r\nThe NUS Faculty of Dentistry is situated at 2 locations; its own building at 11 Lower Kent Ridge Road (at the junction between Medical Drive and Lower Kent Ridge Road) and the other at the National University Hospital (NUH).\r\n\r\nThe main FOD building is within 6 minutes walking distance from NUH. It houses the teaching facilities and clinics for the undergraduate dental students and graduate residents in the fields of Prosthodontics, Orthodontics and Diploma in Implantology. The FOD building also houses the Dean’s office and admin complex together with the Academic staff offices.\r\n\r\nThe facilities at NUH provide graduate residency training in Endodontics, Periodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.

The broad experience and specialisation of the Academic Staff allow them to provide both the Dental Undergraduates and Postgraduates with the requisite skills for dental practice.\r\n\r\nBy 2019, the Faculty will be located in the new National University Centre for Oral Health, Singapore (NUCOHS), with clinical services, education and research facilities under one roof.  Besides a broad range of dental services catering to the Singapore public, it will focus on the elderly and those with medically complex conditions. It will cater to an increased annual undergraduate intake to train more dental professionals, employing advanced simulation laboratories to promote leading-edge and experiential dental training.

Striving for excellence in purposeful achievement is not learnt overnight. It requires discipline, grit and a measure of toughness. The experience of exerting oneself against stiff odds in field and forum is worthwhile even if the limits of endurance are stretched to the extent of numbness. It cannot but breed the qualities of patience, endurance and courage.\r\nTO SEEK: The true university spirit encourages the students to develop an &ldquo;insatiable curiosity&rdquo;. In this age of science and technology, every student and graduate has a duty to contribute to the store of knowledge he receives from past generations. In the Hall, the intermingling of the Fellows and students of the varied discipline should give opportunities for dialogue, discussion and debate on the quest of the &lsquo;Why&rsquo; and &lsquo;How&rsquo;.\r\nTO SERVE: A developing nation needs a core of national builders, dedicated and skilled with a capacity for hard work. Whether the service is scientific research, general practice or the civil service, should not matter; it is the quality of service that counts. Ample opportunities exist in the Hall to develop the sense of community service and individual obligation. &ldquo;To serve and not to be served&rdquo; is a challenge calling for utter dedication and selfless service.

The name King Edward Hall was chosen to restore the historical significance related to the university. To avoid confusion, &lsquo;at KR&rsquo; was included until King Edward Hall at Sepoy Lines closed.King Edward hall at Kent Ridge was officially declared open on 5th December 1981 by then- President of Singapore and Chancellor of NUS, Mr. Devan Nair. Four years later, in December 1985, the hall embraced a new name, departing from KEKR to Kent Ridge Hall in order to create a new identity and tradition free from the shadow of KEVII. Pro-chancellor at NUS, Dr. Justice A. P. Rajah, officiated the Hall Renaming Ceremony.The following year marked the unveiling of the new Hall Crest and Hall Motto by President Wee Kim Wee. The new Hall Motto was first proposed by residents of the hall and then discussed and modified to take the form it has today- &lsquo;Seek, Strive and Excel&rsquo;. The motto expressed the essence of the hall and its residents, the continual seeking for knowledge and truth, the striving for high ideals in spite of difficulties, and the excellence which marks all that is undertaken by us to do. The source of our hall spirit and a driving force of our achievements is our strong family culture. It is believed that the camaraderie forged during our stay here will pave the way for our renewed goal, that of being &ldquo;the Family Hall ever striding for excellence&rdquo;, reinforced by the Family Song introduced in 2002.In November 2002, KR was relocated from its original site in Lower Kent Ridge Road to its current location at Heng Mui Keng Terrace. The move was symbolically represented by having the then-residents walk over to the new building, which was officially opened on 3rd January 2004 by former President S. R. Nathan.Despite the move, the culture of Kent Ridge Hall has not only survived, but thrived in its new home. From outstanding results in FLAG and RAG, yearly productions and most recently, becoming champions of the Inter-Hall Games (IHG) in 2014, it become clear that the spirit of excellence KR embodies remains ever-present in the hall.","id":"295095","websiteKey":"kent-ridge-hall","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/da9bb1ad-d0b5-4c46-a904-8becc4ff64b4c4eb2933-1ee7-43f0-9605-a1909b3f9c7e.jpg","catID":"","name":"Kent Ridge Hall","branchId":262919,"catName":"","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/kent-ridge-hall","__collections__":{}},"LKYSPP":{"websiteKey":"student-life-lkyspp","imgUrl":"","catID":"13682","name":"Student Life @ LKYSPP","branchId":262920,"catName":"Faculty Clubs","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/student-life-lkyspp","info":"Get the latest student life updates, as well as campus events that are exclusive to the LKY School community!

Members of the RCY will be affiliated to the Singapore Red Cross, one of the largest international humanitarian movement in the world. Here are the brief introduction about our projects:\r\nBlood Donation Drive (BDD)\r\nNUS Blood Donation Drive is a joint effort between Red Cross Youth (NUS Chapter) and Health Science Authority (HSA) to provide a convenient avenue for the NUS community to donate blood. As we continue to enlist the generosity of our existing donors, we strive to recruit first-time donors to enlarge our blood donor pool.\r\nDisaster Management Group (DMG) \r\nDMG aims to create a disaster-resilient NUS via first aid and disaster management courses. We contribute to the local community by providing first aid coverage at various events eg. school-based activities, to provide medical assistance when required. Furthermore, first aid exposure and training courses such as the Standard First Aid Training, CPR &amp; AED and ​National Disaster Response Team Training courses are provided to empower our volunteers to readily react to various medical incidents. If you would like to learn life-saving skills or put your existing medical skills into practice, join our team today!\r\nFundraising\r\nThe 3 main objectives of Project Fundraising is: (i) To encourage people to spread love and express their gratitude to their loved ones while contributing for a donatable cause. (ii) To raise funds for the execution of the 8 respective Red Cross Youth Chapter projects. (iii) To inculcate the spirit of volunteerism and to raise the awareness of the current Red Cross Youth Chapter projects amongst the NUS community.\r\nProject CLARE\r\nProject CLARE stands for Community-Led Action for REsilience. Our focus is to increase and facilitate the interaction with the elderly community in Tampines West, especially those who are isolated and low-income earners. We achieve this in two ways. First through our elderly befriending, which requires volunteers to commit to a monthly home visit and phone calls to our elderly beneficiaries. Not only that, Project CLARE also organise events, known as Activities Day, for the elderly living around the Tampines neighbourhood to bond and interact. Through our regular visits and events, we hope to achieve and cultivate a sense of belonging and happiness among the elderly. These interactions encourage the elderly to form new friendships with the volunteers and enjoy the different activities that are prepared for them. Furthermore, volunteers get to develop their communication skills, compassion, understand people from different walks of life and gain insights from the stories that the elderly shares through their visits.\r\nProject R.I.C.E.+\r\nProject Rice+ is SRCY's signature student-run project that is organised annually. Our project started off as a collection and redistribution of rice event 10 years ago. Along the years it has evolved in various forms to its current iteration, for which we are now able to distribute bundle sets containing food items and daily necessities to our beneficiaries islandwide. As part of Project's RICE+ consistent efforts to enhance not just the contents of our bundle sets, but also our personal connection with our beneficiaries, project rice+ 2018 was the first time we conducted beneficiary engagement, a platform for our volunteers to engage with our beneficiaries on the ground through meaningful activities and interaction.\r\nProject Smiles\r\nProject Smiles is an initiative that serves the mentally and physically disabled residents of the Red Cross Home for the Disabled (RCHD). We visit the RCHD on every alternate Sunday morning to interact with our residents, who are mostly bedridden and have limited mobility. By playing interactive games and communicating with them, we hope to improve their motor and social skills. More importantly, by keeping them company, we hope to make them feel that they are never alone. Join us in spreading smiles today! We're excited to hear from you.\r\n7 Days of Happiness (7DOH)\r\nProject 7 Days of Happiness (7DOH) aims to give back and bring joy to the university&rsquo;s Unsung Heroes and students. 7DOH hosts a series of events such as Appreciation Tea sessions and Drinks Dedication to thank our Unsung Heroes for their immense contribution in ensuring the daily functioning of the university. With Appreciation being an important value of the project, we strive to initiate the first step for students to express their gratitude towards our Unsung Volunteers through various platforms. We also serve as the connecting bridge between the students and our organisation for volunteering opportunities with our sister project.\r\ni.Volunteer\r\nAn initiative under NUS Red Cross Youth, i.Volunteer aims to expose NUS students to volunteerism in hopes of inspiring first-time volunteers to become more in touch with the community. i.Volunteer is in its 7th year now and have reached out to more than 20 different organisations, bringing joy to Children, Elderly, the Intellectually Disabled as well as the Physically Disabled among our population. Many volunteers have stepped into i.Volunteer as an individual with little understanding and interest in giving back but left with the heart to serve and have hence gone on to participate in many other volunteer projects. In the span of a day, volunteers get to interact with their beneficiaries closely, giving them the chance to not only forge a new friendship but also the chance to learn the stories of these beneficiaries. With the unwavering support and funding from Office of Student Affairs (OSA), our beneficiaries and volunteers have had the opportunity to engage in many fun-filled activities and outings to local tourist spots.\r\nOverseas Humanitarian Program (OHP)\r\nThe overseas humanitarian program hopes to give NUS students exposure to other national societies in the world on how they operate and function as well as learn best practices so as to improve the programs we have in Singapore. Traditionally the program was designed as an OCIP to help out the less privileged but this year we have modified it to take advantage of Red Cross bring an international organization to bring about a unique experience on what an international organization is about. So join us in this pioneering journey to forge lasting friendships and unforgettable experiences.","id":"295171","websiteKey":"red-cross-youth-nus-chapter","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/073bfb72-7363-4c9a-b7d2-6bde23a1d1aa993d1479-95cf-4b39-b27e-28fa97de8666.jpg","catID":"13694","name":"Red Cross Youth - NUS Chapter","branchId":262921,"catName":"Interest Groups (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/red-cross-youth-nus-chapter","__collections__":{}},"RH":{"catID":"","name":"Raffles Hall","branchId":262919,"catName":"","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/raffles-hall","info":"Founded in 1958, Raffles Hall was one of the first halls to be established in the National University of Singapore (NUS). As such, the hall has a long and rich history. Raffles Hall was originally locaed in Nassim Road, Bukit Timah, alongside Eusoff College. At that time, Raffles Hall was an all-boys hall. However, due to an increase in the number of female students, Raffles Hall officially became co-ed in 1975. In 1981, NUS shifted from the Bukit Timah campus to the current Kent Ridge campus. The establishment of two new halls there took a toll on Raffles Hall&rsquo;s residential numbers. Consequently, Raffles Hall bade farewell to Nassim Road and moved to the Kent Ridge Campus in 1984. The new Raffles Hall site was almost twice the size of the old Nassim Road site. Raffles Hall has its roots in Raffles College, which was one of the institutes of higher learning that merged to eventually form the National University of Singapore (the other being King Edward VII college). Raffles Hall was also modelled after the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and hence many of their traditions trickled down to us. The positions of the Master, Resident Fellows, Junior Common Room Committees (JCRCs) and Senior Common Room Committees (SCRCs) all stemmed from those origins. And although &ldquo;Raffles&rdquo; is a common name for many institutions and organisations in Singapore, Raffles Hall is in no way affiliated to them.","id":"295160","websiteKey":"raffles-hall","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/ea721f12-689b-4b59-9c0c-80fa249b199119e1f755-5b04-44d0-a352-2430ec03a432.jpg","__collections__":{}},"ROVERS":{"imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/2d2207d2-34fe-40c1-9935-56f7a3380e77c4978ac4-6429-499c-88cf-59fdb4d3c6c3.png","catID":"13683","name":"Rovers Adventure Club","branchId":262922,"catName":"Non-Faculty Clubs","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/rovers-adventure-club","info":"The NUS Rovers Adventure Club is an interest group that aims to share our love for outdoor adventure with others.

Presently under the direction of award-winning theatre maker Edith Podesta (Dark Room, Bitch: The Origin Of The Female Species), NUS Stage is steadily growing to become a vibrant and innovative campus group for aspiring theatre-makers. Its members comprise uniquely of NUS students from varying backgrounds who are passionate about inspiring change through riveting performances and creating a common space where people can come together.\r\nRecent productions include A Disappearing Number (NUS Arts Festival 2019 - Opening Show), which unveils a new staging of Complicit&eacute; UK&rsquo;s exquisite and internationally acclaimed play about love, math, and how the past and future connect. Winner of the 2007 Critics&rsquo; Circle Theatre, Evening Standard and Laurence Olivier award for Best New Play, A Disappearing Number was reimagined and brought to the stage for the first time in Singapore by director Edith Podesta, NUS Stage members, along with veteran actors Koh Wan Ching, Pavan J Singh and Ramesh Panicker. Other productions include The Golden Record 2.0 (NUS Arts Festival 2018) which shifts the focus from the universal to the local scene by creating a conversation about the tokens and memories of our nation&rsquo;s identity that Singaporeans will choose to send as a message to the universe when faced by the possibility that such tokens could be sent into space.\r\nNUS Stage seeks to find bold and creative new angles through collaborations with other CFA groups. In 2018, NUS Stage collaborated with Electronic Music Lab (EML) to present The City Remembers, a play drawn heavily from Alfian Sa'at&rsquo;s poetry anthology, A History of Amnesia. Created out of workshops utilizing Anne Bogart&rsquo;s Composition and Laban acting techniques, the actors embodied the stories set to a live soundtrack composed by musicians from EML, which teased out the darker sides of living in a modern multicultural society.\r\nIn addition to acting, NUS Stage members also get to hone their crafts by taking on different roles such as playwriting, directing and stage managing in the annual student-led showcase.

We are committed to bringing you the best student life experience on and off the field.&nbsp;\r\nWhat is NUS Silat?\r\nTo start, Silat is a martial art that originated in the Malay archipelago, namely Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. It consists of striking such as punches and kicks and also grabs, throws and take-downs. There are 2 aspects to it, Seni (artisitc) and Tanding (fighting) which makes use of the different techniques in silat. Here at NUS Silat, we are an NUS Varsity Team that trains competitively in Seni and Tanding.\r\nCompetition and Training Sessions\r\nOur varsity team competes in one main competition each academic year - the annual Tertiary Silat Championship in Semester 1. As we are a mixed gender team, we train together on Mondays and Thursdays at MPSH 2 from 6.30pm to 9.30 pm with a half hour break in between.&nbsp;Even amidst the unfortunate Covid-19 situation, we are still active and highly motivated to keep ourselves fit by engaging in virtual training sessions through Zoom/Skype.\r\nOur team works ardently to soar higher and achieve better results every year. As proven, we have managed to increase our medal tally and overall position from 2018 to 2019 at the annual Tertiary Silat Championship. This is a result of our coaches training us athletes to be fearless and resilient during training and in competition - following our motto of &ldquo;Respect All, Fear None&rdquo;.&nbsp;\r\nNUS Silat Values\r\nHere at NUS Silat, we have three core beliefs that every athlete must embody&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGive your 100%\r\nSupport one another\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nThese tenets are simple, yet they drive our attitude during training. It is common to see us pushing beyond our limits and cheering to support one another during training. While we train hard, we play hard as well - initiating several impromptu meals or having a mass bonding session throughout the semester. We have our annual Hari Raya Outing, Iftar and Bonding Camp to bond as a team. We welcome all students, regardless of ethnicity or sports background, to have fun and sweat it out with us during our training sessions.&nbsp;\r\nNUS Silat gives back\r\nNUS Silat firmly believes in giving back to the community. For the past few years, NUS Silat has volunteered during the fasting months to distribute food for the break fast to those who need it more. On top of that, we recently collaborated with other NUS Varsity Teams under MAXINUS, a NUS Taekwondo-led service project, to pass on the knowledge of Silat to primary school children.\r\nContact us\r\nFor more of what we do as NUS Silat, check out our Instagram and  Facebook page or drop any of the exco members a message.

The name King Edward Hall was chosen to restore the historical significance related to the university. To avoid confusion, &lsquo;at KR&rsquo; was included until King Edward Hall at Sepoy Lines closed.King Edward hall at Kent Ridge was officially declared open on 5th December 1981 by then- President of Singapore and Chancellor of NUS, Mr. Devan Nair. Four years later, in December 1985, the hall embraced a new name, departing from KEKR to Kent Ridge Hall in order to create a new identity and tradition free from the shadow of KEVII. Pro-chancellor at NUS, Dr. Justice A. P. Rajah, officiated the Hall Renaming Ceremony.The following year marked the unveiling of the new Hall Crest and Hall Motto by President Wee Kim Wee. The new Hall Motto was first proposed by residents of the hall and then discussed and modified to take the form it has today- &lsquo;Seek, Strive and Excel&rsquo;. The motto expressed the essence of the hall and its residents, the continual seeking for knowledge and truth, the striving for high ideals in spite of difficulties, and the excellence which marks all that is undertaken by us to do. The source of our hall spirit and a driving force of our achievements is our strong family culture. It is believed that the camaraderie forged during our stay here will pave the way for our renewed goal, that of being &ldquo;the Family Hall ever striding for excellence&rdquo;, reinforced by the Family Song introduced in 2002.In November 2002, KR was relocated from its original site in Lower Kent Ridge Road to its current location at Heng Mui Keng Terrace. The move was symbolically represented by having the then-residents walk over to the new building, which was officially opened on 3rd January 2004 by former President S. R. Nathan.Despite the move, the culture of Kent Ridge Hall has not only survived, but thrived in its new home. From outstanding results in FLAG and RAG, yearly productions and most recently, becoming champions of the Inter-Hall Games (IHG) in 2014, it become clear that the spirit of excellence KR embodies remains ever-present in the hall.","id":"295095","websiteKey":"kent-ridge-hall","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/da9bb1ad-d0b5-4c46-a904-8becc4ff64b4c4eb2933-1ee7-43f0-9605-a1909b3f9c7e.jpg","catID":"","name":"Kent Ridge Hall","branchId":262919,"catName":"","__collections__":{}},"King Edward VII Hall":{"info":"The motto &ldquo;To strive, To seek, To serve&rdquo; embodies the philosophy of KEVII Hall.\r\nTO STRIVE: To attempt great things &ldquo;for God and country&rdquo; has been the battle cry of soldiers and the catalyst that drove sailors like Columbus and Magellan to seek new worlds. Striving for excellence in purposeful achievement is not learnt overnight. It requires discipline, grit and a measure of toughness. The experience of exerting oneself against stiff odds in field and forum is worthwhile even if the limits of endurance are stretched to the extent of numbness. It cannot but breed the qualities of patience, endurance and courage.\r\nTO SEEK: The true university spirit encourages the students to develop an &ldquo;insatiable curiosity&rdquo;. In this age of science and technology, every student and graduate has a duty to contribute to the store of knowledge he receives from past generations. In the Hall, the intermingling of the Fellows and students of the varied discipline should give opportunities for dialogue, discussion and debate on the quest of the &lsquo;Why&rsquo; and &lsquo;How&rsquo;.\r\nTO SERVE: A developing nation needs a core of national builders, dedicated and skilled with a capacity for hard work. Whether the service is scientific research, general practice or the civil service, should not matter; it is the quality of service that counts. Ample opportunities exist in the Hall to develop the sense of community service and individual obligation. &ldquo;To serve and not to be served&rdquo; is a challenge calling for utter dedication and selfless service. The response cannot come from without but from within the person.","id":"295032","websiteKey":"king-edward-vii-hall","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/04b73bd3-9e29-41e6-a161-6591954ab213687f01de-568a-4a50-abf9-d40715fb785f.png","catID":"","name":"King Edward VII Hall","branchId":262919,"catName":"","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/king-edward-vii-hall","__collections__":{}},"Korean Cultural Interest Group":{"catID":"13694","name":"Korean Cultural Interest Group","branchId":262921,"catName":"Interest Groups (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/korean-cultural-interest-group","info":"To promote Korean culture to the entire NUS student body as well as to provide a welcoming platform for all students interested in Korea.","cat":2,"id":"295224","websiteKey":"korean-cultural-interest-group","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/320a3686-19f7-4247-824e-539e5baf34564d99de02-3f82-450e-aa25-2b5d9733e53d.jpg","__collections__":{}},"Malay Language Society":{"catName":"Societies (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/malay-language-society","info":"Persatuan Bahasa Melayu University Kebangsaan Singapura (PBMUKS) is also known as the National University of Singapore Malay Language Society.","cat":2,"id":"295143","websiteKey":"malay-language-society","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/8b727386-f005-4eeb-a6cf-f6e4b67a2178c95beb82-6ebb-44e5-b079-02aa5439729c.jpg","catID":"13695","name":"Malay Language Society","branchId":262917,"__collections__":{}},"NUANSA Cultural Productions":{"url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/nuansacp","info":"NUANSA is a musical cultural production presented by the students of National University of Singapore.

Presently under the direction of award-winning theatre maker Edith Podesta (Dark Room, Bitch: The Origin Of The Female Species), NUS Stage is steadily growing to become a vibrant and innovative campus group for aspiring theatre-makers. Its members comprise uniquely of NUS students from varying backgrounds who are passionate about inspiring change through riveting performances and creating a common space where people can come together.\r\nRecent productions include A Disappearing Number (NUS Arts Festival 2019 - Opening Show), which unveils a new staging of Complicit&eacute; UK&rsquo;s exquisite and internationally acclaimed play about love, math, and how the past and future connect. Winner of the 2007 Critics&rsquo; Circle Theatre, Evening Standard and Laurence Olivier award for Best New Play, A Disappearing Number was reimagined and brought to the stage for the first time in Singapore by director Edith Podesta, NUS Stage members, along with veteran actors Koh Wan Ching, Pavan J Singh and Ramesh Panicker. Other productions include The Golden Record 2.0 (NUS Arts Festival 2018) which shifts the focus from the universal to the local scene by creating a conversation about the tokens and memories of our nation&rsquo;s identity that Singaporeans will choose to send as a message to the universe when faced by the possibility that such tokens could be sent into space.\r\nNUS Stage seeks to find bold and creative new angles through collaborations with other CFA groups. In 2018, NUS Stage collaborated with Electronic Music Lab (EML) to present The City Remembers, a play drawn heavily from Alfian Sa'at&rsquo;s poetry anthology, A History of Amnesia. Created out of workshops utilizing Anne Bogart&rsquo;s Composition and Laban acting techniques, the actors embodied the stories set to a live soundtrack composed by musicians from EML, which teased out the darker sides of living in a modern multicultural society.\r\nIn addition to acting, NUS Stage members also get to hone their crafts by taking on different roles such as playwriting, directing and stage managing in the annual student-led showcase. Through greater freedom to experiment with theatre, members explore different facets of putting on a production and discover where their strengths best lie in the art of theatre-making.","cat":8,"id":"295104","websiteKey":"nus-stage","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/72605193-3850-476c-aae2-2504413d39d6cb1ea191-ec39-452b-a00d-3307ad4d77a1.png","catID":"","name":"NUS STAGE","branchId":262916,"catName":"","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/nus-stage","__collections__":{}},"NUS Sailing":{"catName":"Varsity Teams","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/nussailing","info":"COMPETITIONS\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAt the tertiary level, our competitive teams participate in regattas organised by the Singapore Sailing Federation (SSF) each academic year, the National Inter-Tertiary Sailing Championships.

We are committed to bringing you the best student life experience on and off the field.&nbsp;\r\nWhat is NUS Silat?\r\nTo start, Silat is a martial art that originated in the Malay archipelago, namely Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. It consists of striking such as punches and kicks and also grabs, throws and take-downs. There are 2 aspects to it, Seni (artisitc) and Tanding (fighting) which makes use of the different techniques in silat. Here at NUS Silat, we are an NUS Varsity Team that trains competitively in Seni and Tanding.\r\nCompetition and Training Sessions\r\nOur varsity team competes in one main competition each academic year - the annual Tertiary Silat Championship in Semester 1. As we are a mixed gender team, we train together on Mondays and Thursdays at MPSH 2 from 6.30pm to 9.30 pm with a half hour break in between.&nbsp;Even amidst the unfortunate Covid-19 situation, we are still active and highly motivated to keep ourselves fit by engaging in virtual training sessions through Zoom/Skype.\r\nOur team works ardently to soar higher and achieve better results every year. As proven, we have managed to increase our medal tally and overall position from 2018 to 2019 at the annual Tertiary Silat Championship. This is a result of our coaches training us athletes to be fearless and resilient during training and in competition - following our motto of &ldquo;Respect All, Fear None&rdquo;.&nbsp;\r\nNUS Silat Values\r\nHere at NUS Silat, we have three core beliefs that every athlete must embody&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGive your 100%\r\nSupport one another\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nThese tenets are simple, yet they drive our attitude during training. It is common to see us pushing beyond our limits and cheering to support one another during training. While we train hard, we play hard as well - initiating several impromptu meals or having a mass bonding session throughout the semester. We have our annual Hari Raya Outing, Iftar and Bonding Camp to bond as a team. We welcome all students, regardless of ethnicity or sports background, to have fun and sweat it out with us during our training sessions.&nbsp;\r\nNUS Silat gives back\r\nNUS Silat firmly believes in giving back to the community. For the past few years, NUS Silat has volunteered during the fasting months to distribute food for the break fast to those who need it more. On top of that, we recently collaborated with other NUS Varsity Teams under MAXINUS, a NUS Taekwondo-led service project, to pass on the knowledge of Silat to primary school children.\r\nContact us\r\nFor more of what we do as NUS Silat, check out our Instagram and  Facebook page or drop any of the exco members a message.

As such, the hall has a long and rich history. Raffles Hall was originally locaed in Nassim Road, Bukit Timah, alongside Eusoff College. At that time, Raffles Hall was an all-boys hall. However, due to an increase in the number of female students, Raffles Hall officially became co-ed in 1975. In 1981, NUS shifted from the Bukit Timah campus to the current Kent Ridge campus. The establishment of two new halls there took a toll on Raffles Hall&rsquo;s residential numbers. Consequently, Raffles Hall bade farewell to Nassim Road and moved to the Kent Ridge Campus in 1984. The new Raffles Hall site was almost twice the size of the old Nassim Road site. Raffles Hall has its roots in Raffles College, which was one of the institutes of higher learning that merged to eventually form the National University of Singapore (the other being King Edward VII college). Raffles Hall was also modelled after the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and hence many of their traditions trickled down to us. The positions of the Master, Resident Fellows, Junior Common Room Committees (JCRCs) and Senior Common Room Committees (SCRCs) all stemmed from those origins.

Members of the RCY will be affiliated to the Singapore Red Cross, one of the largest international humanitarian movement in the world. Here are the brief introduction about our projects:\r\nBlood Donation Drive (BDD)\r\nNUS Blood Donation Drive is a joint effort between Red Cross Youth (NUS Chapter) and Health Science Authority (HSA) to provide a convenient avenue for the NUS community to donate blood. As we continue to enlist the generosity of our existing donors, we strive to recruit first-time donors to enlarge our blood donor pool.\r\nDisaster Management Group (DMG) \r\nDMG aims to create a disaster-resilient NUS via first aid and disaster management courses. We contribute to the local community by providing first aid coverage at various events eg. school-based activities, to provide medical assistance when required. Furthermore, first aid exposure and training courses such as the Standard First Aid Training, CPR &amp; AED and ​National Disaster Response Team Training courses are provided to empower our volunteers to readily react to various medical incidents. If you would like to learn life-saving skills or put your existing medical skills into practice, join our team today!\r\nFundraising\r\nThe 3 main objectives of Project Fundraising is: (i) To encourage people to spread love and express their gratitude to their loved ones while contributing for a donatable cause. (ii) To raise funds for the execution of the 8 respective Red Cross Youth Chapter projects. (iii) To inculcate the spirit of volunteerism and to raise the awareness of the current Red Cross Youth Chapter projects amongst the NUS community.\r\nProject CLARE\r\nProject CLARE stands for Community-Led Action for REsilience. Our focus is to increase and facilitate the interaction with the elderly community in Tampines West, especially those who are isolated and low-income earners. We achieve this in two ways. First through our elderly befriending, which requires volunteers to commit to a monthly home visit and phone calls to our elderly beneficiaries. Not only that, Project CLARE also organise events, known as Activities Day, for the elderly living around the Tampines neighbourhood to bond and interact. Through our regular visits and events, we hope to achieve and cultivate a sense of belonging and happiness among the elderly. These interactions encourage the elderly to form new friendships with the volunteers and enjoy the different activities that are prepared for them. Furthermore, volunteers get to develop their communication skills, compassion, understand people from different walks of life and gain insights from the stories that the elderly shares through their visits.\r\nProject R.I.C.E.+\r\nProject Rice+ is SRCY's signature student-run project that is organised annually. Our project started off as a collection and redistribution of rice event 10 years ago. Along the years it has evolved in various forms to its current iteration, for which we are now able to distribute bundle sets containing food items and daily necessities to our beneficiaries islandwide. As part of Project's RICE+ consistent efforts to enhance not just the contents of our bundle sets, but also our personal connection with our beneficiaries, project rice+ 2018 was the first time we conducted beneficiary engagement, a platform for our volunteers to engage with our beneficiaries on the ground through meaningful activities and interaction.\r\nProject Smiles\r\nProject Smiles is an initiative that serves the mentally and physically disabled residents of the Red Cross Home for the Disabled (RCHD). We visit the RCHD on every alternate Sunday morning to interact with our residents, who are mostly bedridden and have limited mobility. By playing interactive games and communicating with them, we hope to improve their motor and social skills. More importantly, by keeping them company, we hope to make them feel that they are never alone. Join us in spreading smiles today! We're excited to hear from you.\r\n7 Days of Happiness (7DOH)\r\nProject 7 Days of Happiness (7DOH) aims to give back and bring joy to the university&rsquo;s Unsung Heroes and students. 7DOH hosts a series of events such as Appreciation Tea sessions and Drinks Dedication to thank our Unsung Heroes for their immense contribution in ensuring the daily functioning of the university. With Appreciation being an important value of the project, we strive to initiate the first step for students to express their gratitude towards our Unsung Volunteers through various platforms. We also serve as the connecting bridge between the students and our organisation for volunteering opportunities with our sister project.\r\ni.Volunteer\r\nAn initiative under NUS Red Cross Youth, i.Volunteer aims to expose NUS students to volunteerism in hopes of inspiring first-time volunteers to become more in touch with the community. i.Volunteer is in its 7th year now and have reached out to more than 20 different organisations, bringing joy to Children, Elderly, the Intellectually Disabled as well as the Physically Disabled among our population. Many volunteers have stepped into i.Volunteer as an individual with little understanding and interest in giving back but left with the heart to serve and have hence gone on to participate in many other volunteer projects. In the span of a day, volunteers get to interact with their beneficiaries closely, giving them the chance to not only forge a new friendship but also the chance to learn the stories of these beneficiaries. With the unwavering support and funding from Office of Student Affairs (OSA), our beneficiaries and volunteers have had the opportunity to engage in many fun-filled activities and outings to local tourist spots.\r\nOverseas Humanitarian Program (OHP)\r\nThe overseas humanitarian program hopes to give NUS students exposure to other national societies in the world on how they operate and function as well as learn best practices so as to improve the programs we have in Singapore. Traditionally the program was designed as an OCIP to help out the less privileged but this year we have modified it to take advantage of Red Cross bring an international organization to bring about a unique experience on what an international organization is about. So join us in this pioneering journey to forge lasting friendships and unforgettable experiences.","cat":3,"id":"295171","websiteKey":"red-cross-youth-nus-chapter","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/073bfb72-7363-4c9a-b7d2-6bde23a1d1aa993d1479-95cf-4b39-b27e-28fa97de8666.jpg","catID":"13694","name":"Red Cross Youth - NUS Chapter","branchId":262921,"catName":"Interest Groups (Non-Academic)","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/red-cross-youth-nus-chapter","__collections__":{}},"Residential College 4":{"catID":"13687","name":"Residential College 4","branchId":262919,"catName":"Residential Colleges","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/rc4","info":"RC4 intends to integrate academic and personal life in a residential setting to develop &ldquo;Systems Thinking&rdquo; using interdisciplinary issues, foster all around student development through in- and out-of-class learning experiences.

Today, the FOD is made up of five Disciplines – Discipline of Prosthodontics, Operative Dentistry and Endodontics; Discipline of Periodontics; Discipline of Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry; Discipline of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Discipline of Oral Sciences – and the Division of Graduate Dental Studies. Together, they strive to fulfil the Faculty’s mission of excelling in clinical care, research and education. Currently, the Faculty has an intake of 54 undergraduates students annually.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty works closely with departments in the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and other teaching hospitals and institutions across Singapore in healthcare delivery and education. It also partners departments in other faculties of the University, public institutions and private enterprises in multi-disciplinary research activities.\r\n\r\nThe NUS Faculty of Dentistry is situated at 2 locations; its own building at 11 Lower Kent Ridge Road (at the junction between Medical Drive and Lower Kent Ridge Road) and the other at the National University Hospital (NUH).\r\n\r\nThe main FOD building is within 6 minutes walking distance from NUH. It houses the teaching facilities and clinics for the undergraduate dental students and graduate residents in the fields of Prosthodontics, Orthodontics and Diploma in Implantology. The FOD building also houses the Dean’s office and admin complex together with the Academic staff offices.\r\n\r\nThe facilities at NUH provide graduate residency training in Endodontics, Periodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.

Besides a broad range of dental services catering to the Singapore public, it will focus on the elderly and those with medically complex conditions. It will cater to an increased annual undergraduate intake to train more dental professionals, employing advanced simulation laboratories to promote leading-edge and experiential dental training.

The colleges, the first of their kind in Singapore and Southeast Asia, provide an exciting alternative to undergraduate campus living. In addition to extracurricular activities, most incoming freshmen will take five of their classes at the College over a two year period, helping them fulfil their university-level degree requirements (ULRs). Some students from non-modular faculties (whose course requirements may be reduced or waived), and students on semestral exchange programmes add to the residential mix. Students from any NUS faculty are eligible to apply. Freshmen normally reside in Tembusu College for two years during which they complete our five-module schedule. Additionally, the College provides many opportunities for learning on a daily basis. Faculty members and visiting scholars from prestigious overseas institutions also live at the College and take meals in the same dining hall as students. There are regular &lsquo;Master&rsquo;s Teas&rsquo; and other events at which small groups of students can interact with distinguished visitors in a relaxed, non-classroom setting. Tembusu College students also enjoy easy access to a wide array of UTown facilities, and are invited to participate in a myriad of exciting sporting and social activities. The three buildings of the College house approximately 570 undergraduates, a small number of graduate student advisors, as well as Residential Fellows, their families, and distinguished guests. UTown is connected to the Kent Ridge campus by frequent shuttle buses and a pedestrian bridge. Many regular NUS classes, especially those for freshmen, also take place at UTown&rsquo;s Education Resource Centre and the Stephen Riady Centre, both just opposite Tembusu College.&nbsp;Tembusu College&rsquo;s motto is The Home of Possibilities.","id":"295128","websiteKey":"tembusu-residential-college","imgUrl":"https://se-infra-imageserver2.azureedge.net/clink/images/d17c0907-8e79-4d4e-935b-b6557aa66bb63be567d8-8087-45dd-91a8-1f6d327ddd60.jpg","catID":"13687","name":"Tembusu Residential College","branchId":262919,"catName":"Residential Colleges","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/tembusu-residential-college","__collections__":{}},"The Architecture Society, NUS":{"imgUrl":"","catID":"","name":"The Architecture Society, NUS","branchId":262921,"catName":"","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/the-architecture-society-nus","info":"The Architecture Society is a student body representing the interests of Architecture students at the National University of Singapore.","cat":5,"id":"295237","websiteKey":"the-architecture-society-nus","__collections__":{}},"The Asian Journal of Public Affairs":{"catName":"","url":"https://nus.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/the-asian-journal-of-public-affairs","info":"Vision\r\nThe Asian Journal of Public Affairs (AJPA) seeks to be the choice journal for scholars and practitioners interested in public affairs in the Asia-Pacific region.

Every March, the NUSChoir stages its annual concert, Varsity Voices, performing an extensive range of repertoire that features choral music, both old and new. Aside from its annual concert, the choir also performs for local audiences outside NUS. In addition, the choir showcases a repertoire of Christmas carols every December at numerous hotels, high society clubs and shopping centres.

Popularly known as SQ, here’s what he has to say!\n> When did you start breaking?\n2008.\n.\n>What is breaking to you?\nA hobby, a distraction from work, a break from stress, an exercise, a time to create, a metaphor for life, a place to progress and learn.\n.\n>What would you look out for when judging?\nCleanliness, style, originality, musicality.\n.\n>What advice would you give to the freshies who are attending the jam for the first time?\nLet's be honest. You're a uni student. You're studying computer science, engineering, economics, business, etc. You may have a plan for the future and that likely does not involve breaking. \nSo, make the jam fun for yourself. This is an internal jam, not a competitive one. Everyone's your friend or friendly. Enjoy the music, enjoy the vibes, have a dance conversation with your friends. \nThis jam says nothing about you. If you lose, it doesn't mean you are bad. If you win, it doesn't mean you're good. It's for fun. So, just enjoy it. \nLastly, if you're prepping for the jam, focus on two things.

This time, we are featuring an unprecedented collaboration with NUS KotoKottoN, where you will get to experience the creative interweaving of music from two different stringed instruments, the guitar and the koto (a traditional Japanese zither). Set in the Edo period of Japanese history 🇯🇵 , Variations on Sakura 🌸 will delight you with a unique rendition of the traditional folk song originally written for the koto by Michio Miyagi, a blind composer.

Today, we have Hui Ya from Project Smiles to share to share her experience. ☺☺\n.\nFrequency of events held in a year for the project: Every alternate Sunday, 10 am-1 pm\n.\nWhy should they join your project and what’s interesting about your project:\n.\nWith the recent circuit breaker measures, how many of y’all felt bored at home and were counting down to the number of days left? 😩 Luckily, we have apps like Houseparty to video call and play games with our friends!! 🤪 .\nHowever, what if we had no access to these apps? We won’t have anyone to socialize with. Now imagine being in that situation for a long time to come.\n.\nThis is what our residents face every day. At the Red Cross Home for the Disabled (RCHD), our friendly residents, who are also mentally and physically disabled, have physical restrictions and limited opportunities to interact with people.\n.\nLike us, they have their own interests 🤓 They love ball games, coloring, and singalong sessions, and are willing to connect with people from all walks of life!!\n.\nHowever, they do not have regular activities organized to fill their weekends.

We won’t have anyone to socialize with. Now imagine being in that situation for a long time to come.\n.\nThis is what our residents face every day. At the Red Cross Home for the Disabled (RCHD), our friendly residents, who are also mentally and physically disabled, have physical restrictions and limited opportunities to interact with people.\n.\nLike us, they have their own interests 🤓 They love ball games, coloring, and singalong sessions, and are willing to connect with people from all walks of life!!\n.\nHowever, they do not have regular activities organized to fill their weekends.

Popularly known as SQ, here’s what he has to say!\n> When did you start breaking?\n2008.\n.\n>What is breaking to you?\nA hobby, a distraction from work, a break from stress, an exercise, a time to create, a metaphor for life, a place to progress and learn.\n.\n>What would you look out for when judging?\nCleanliness, style, originality, musicality.\n.\n>What advice would you give to the freshies who are attending the jam for the first time?\nLet's be honest. You're a uni student. You're studying computer science, engineering, economics, business, etc. You may have a plan for the future and that likely does not involve breaking. \nSo, make the jam fun for yourself. This is an internal jam, not a competitive one. Everyone's your friend or friendly. Enjoy the music, enjoy the vibes, have a dance conversation with your friends. \nThis jam says nothing about you. If you lose, it doesn't mean you are bad. If you win, it doesn't mean you're good. It's for fun. So, just enjoy it. \nLastly, if you're prepping for the jam, focus on two things. Your foundational moves and executing them well. You're still young, still learning. Things like style, flava, originality don't matter for you yet. Make sure your foundation's good and you're doing them properly. Take this week to drill it. \nDoing the simplest things is sometimes the hardest :)\n___\n\nREMEMBER:\nDate: 17 November 2019\nTime: 1-7pm\nLocation: Utown DA2\n\nSEE YALL THERE! 😚😋","16 Nov":"ENTER: BreakiNUS Internal Jam 2019 ☄️🗯🤯\n.\nOnly 1 more day to our annual BreakiNUS Internal Jam! 💥 ARE YOU READY?!?!😈👻\n.\nScratchin the disc for tomorrow, we have the ex-president of BreakiNUS, Mervyn! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nHi it me.

We hope that our event will build on the physical, mental and spiritual strength that they need to get through this difficult period. This activity will unlock a tenacious mindset that inspires participants to give their best even if they have little to offer, as participants will be exposed to the notion that even their seemingly insignificant actions can reap rewards and aid others.\r\nOur belief system (Iman) acts as a source of motivation for our participants to be consistent with their commitments and push themselves further. Similarly, we want to emphasize the importance of&nbsp; consistency when it comes to performing obligatory acts such as the 5 daily prayers.

There, we met our guides who would bring us around Bukit Brown and tell us about its history, from war stories to stories of upbringing and royalty.

Popularly known as SQ, here’s what he has to say!\n> When did you start breaking?\n2008.\n.\n>What is breaking to you?\nA hobby, a distraction from work, a break from stress, an exercise, a time to create, a metaphor for life, a place to progress and learn.\n.\n>What would you look out for when judging?\nCleanliness, style, originality, musicality.\n.\n>What advice would you give to the freshies who are attending the jam for the first time?\nLet's be honest. You're a uni student. You're studying computer science, engineering, economics, business, etc. You may have a plan for the future and that likely does not involve breaking. \nSo, make the jam fun for yourself. This is an internal jam, not a competitive one. Everyone's your friend or friendly. Enjoy the music, enjoy the vibes, have a dance conversation with your friends. \nThis jam says nothing about you. If you lose, it doesn't mean you are bad. If you win, it doesn't mean you're good. It's for fun. So, just enjoy it. \nLastly, if you're prepping for the jam, focus on two things. Your foundational moves and executing them well. You're still young, still learning. Things like style, flava, originality don't matter for you yet. Make sure your foundation's good and you're doing them properly. Take this week to drill it. \nDoing the simplest things is sometimes the hardest :)\n___\n\nREMEMBER:\nDate: 17 November 2019\nTime: 1-7pm\nLocation: Utown DA2\n\nSEE YALL THERE! 😚😋","16 Nov":"ENTER: BreakiNUS Internal Jam 2019 ☄️🗯🤯\n.\nOnly 1 more day to our annual BreakiNUS Internal Jam! 💥 ARE YOU READY?!?!😈👻\n.\nScratchin the disc for tomorrow, we have the ex-president of BreakiNUS, Mervyn! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nHi it me.

We hope that our event will build on the physical, mental and spiritual strength that they need to get through this difficult period. This activity will unlock a tenacious mindset that inspires participants to give their best even if they have little to offer, as participants will be exposed to the notion that even their seemingly insignificant actions can reap rewards and aid others.\r\nOur belief system (Iman) acts as a source of motivation for our participants to be consistent with their commitments and push themselves further. Similarly, we want to emphasize the importance of&nbsp; consistency when it comes to performing obligatory acts such as the 5 daily prayers.

There, we met our guides who would bring us around Bukit Brown and tell us about its history, from war stories to stories of upbringing and royalty.

Popularly known as SQ, here’s what he has to say!\n> When did you start breaking?\n2008.\n.\n>What is breaking to you?\nA hobby, a distraction from work, a break from stress, an exercise, a time to create, a metaphor for life, a place to progress and learn.\n.\n>What would you look out for when judging?\nCleanliness, style, originality, musicality.\n.\n>What advice would you give to the freshies who are attending the jam for the first time?\nLet's be honest. You're a uni student. You're studying computer science, engineering, economics, business, etc. You may have a plan for the future and that likely does not involve breaking. \nSo, make the jam fun for yourself. This is an internal jam, not a competitive one. Everyone's your friend or friendly. Enjoy the music, enjoy the vibes, have a dance conversation with your friends. \nThis jam says nothing about you. If you lose, it doesn't mean you are bad. If you win, it doesn't mean you're good. It's for fun. So, just enjoy it. \nLastly, if you're prepping for the jam, focus on two things. Your foundational moves and executing them well. You're still young, still learning. Things like style, flava, originality don't matter for you yet. Make sure your foundation's good and you're doing them properly. Take this week to drill it. \nDoing the simplest things is sometimes the hardest :)\n___\n\nREMEMBER:\nDate: 17 November 2019\nTime: 1-7pm\nLocation: Utown DA2\n\nSEE YALL THERE! 😚😋"},"image":"NUS Students' Cultural Activities Club_191117.png","postDate":"16 Nov","usersAttending":[],"time":{"__datatype__":"timestamp","value":{"_seconds":1573995600,"_nanoseconds":0}},"numberAttending":0,"info":"ENTER: BreakiNUS Internal Jam 2019 ☄️🗯🤯\n.\nOnly 1 more day to our annual BreakiNUS Internal Jam! 💥 ARE YOU READY?!?!😈👻\n.\nScratchin the disc for tomorrow, we have the ex-president of BreakiNUS, Mervyn! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nHi it me.
